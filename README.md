CS360 - Mobile Architecture &amp; Programming

•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app I chose to work on in this course is Weight Tracker. This app was supposed to help its users have a visual representation of their weight loss or gain journey. The app’s user was supposed to be able to set a weight goal and log in their weight daily. Then, the app would represent this information in a form of a basic table. Also, the users were supposed to be able to change their weight goal at any moment during their journey. 

•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

In order to support the users’ needs, it was necessary to create five screens: login and registration, the main screen with the weight table, settings, weight editing, and weight adding. While working on the weight-tracking app, I did my best to prioritize user needs and provide an enjoyable experience. I made an effort to focus on user-centric features and functions while maintaining a straightforward and intuitive design. Additionally, I tried to keep the app's colors, font, and navigation visually consistent. Using well-known UI patterns and user-friendly controls to create a simple, minimalist user interface that is suited for small screens was another goal I set out to accomplish.

•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

When creating an app, I feel that it is more practical for me to start with the back end or fundamental logic and add basic UI elements. After the desired functionality is accomplished, I focus on the app's visual design. I'm aware that a lot of people would rather start with the UX/UI portion, but I personally find it ineffective. Following the creation of the fundamental architecture, I usually work on simple objects. Next, I make a connection between the classes in charge of the interactive features and the objects that store data. In my code, I also make an effort to provide comments. This is a really beneficial technique. When I'm working on a project, I try my best to make notes for myself about things I need to accomplish. Sometimes, I simply get an idea for something, like how great it would be to add a feature, and by the time I get around to it, the idea has vanished. Nonetheless, I can never forget my brilliant ideas thanks to my TODO notes.

•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

When it comes to testing the app, I always prefer to conduct a test after every change to its significant part. I really enjoy concentrating on little iterations while I'm working on an app. It seems simple to get carried away once we start coding. However, this poses a risk since we could create a large number of flaws that will be extremely difficult to find. On the other hand, we increase our chances of success if we focus on tiny portions of the project and test them often.

•	Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

There was a part of this project that was completely new to me and therefore challenging. I have never worked in the user interface before. Thus, I was trying to research and implement the best practices of UX/UI design. There are a few very great sites that I draw inspiration from for the app's design. For example, colorhunt.co/ is a terrific resource for finding the perfect color scheme. Icons and stickers may be found on the fantastic website https://www.flaticon.com/. Additionally, I feel that https://www.canva.com/ is a great source of general design inspiration.

•	In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I do not think there is a particular part of this project that I am necessarily most proud of. My method of approaching projects has probably altered as a result of this course. Before I understood all the technical requirements, I would often spend too much time considering the app's design. I've learned from this course that it's crucial to know exactly what your app needs to do before I start caring about how it looks. Though I was genuinely skeptical that I could create a workable app in a matter of seven weeks, it ended up looking very good. I think this project can really be something to be proud of.
